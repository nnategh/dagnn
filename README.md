## DAGNN - Directed Acyclic Graph Neural Network

The project focuses on trying to design an artificial neural network architecture capable of learning and replicating a noisy 1D signal. The goal is to be able to replicate the behavior of the retina's neural layers using an artificial neural network.  

The motivation behind the project stems from the retina's neural layers, which have proven to be extremely effecient at processing visual input. As explained in [1], "in only three layers
of cells, the retina compresses the entire visual scene into the sparse responses of only a million output cells."

Notwithstanding its deceptive simplicity, "the retina performs a wide range of nonlinear computations, including object motion detection, adaptation to complex spatiotemporal patterns, encoding spatial structure as spike latency."  

## Prerequisites

Before starting the installation program, 

* For **macOS**, make sure you have *Xcode* installed. A copy can be obtained for free from the Mac App Store. If ``mex -setup`` returns errors, see troubleshooting.
* For **Linux**, make sure you have *GCC 4.8* and *LibJPEG* are installed. To install *LibJPEG* in and *Ubuntu/Debian*-like distributions use: ``sudo apt-get install build-essential libjpeg-turbo8-dev`` For *Fedora/Centos/RedHat*-like distributions use instead: ``sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ libjpeg-turbo-devel`` Older versions of *GCC (e.g. 4.7)* are not compatible with the *C++* code in *MatConvNet*.
* For **Windows**, make sure you have *Visual Studio 2015* or greater installed.

Also, make sure the following Matlab toolboxes are installed:
* Signal Processing Toolbox
* DSP System Toolbox
* Parallel Computing Toolbox
* Communications System Toolbox
* Bioinformatics Toolbox
* Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

## Installation

To install, run <a href="https://github.com/Ya-Za/dagnn/raw/master/setup.m" download>``setup.m``</a> (Right click and "Save link as" to download file) in the directory where you want to install the program. The output will let you know whether you will need any additional toolboxes.

## Execution

To execute the code, first add the path `matconvnet/matlab` using the command

	addpath matconvnet/matlab

To run the program, run the file `DagNNNoisy.m` using the following command

	DagNNNoisy.main()

## Parameters and Data

The paths for the parameters and data are specified as variables atop `DagNNNoisy.m`. The parameters can be changed by modifying the json files to be read, while the data can be modified by creating new data `.mat` files.

## Setting Up a University of Utah CHPC Account (optional)

Alternatively, one can create a Center For High Performance Computing (CHPC) account to run the program on Utah CHPC servers. To do so, please [click here](https://www.chpc.utah.edu/userservices/accounts.php) for instructions.

Once logged into a CHPC server, perform steps in [Installation section](#installation) to install. Then execute.
